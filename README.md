# Hangman

You probably played Hangman when you were young, this game is super funny and when you have no idea about what to do, we easily invite our friends to play Hangman, or in French, the so-called : "Jeu du pendu", the rule is easy : one word and the players have to guess what the word, trying to say some letters which may compose the word.

BECAREFUL, many mistakes and the man died ! So.. find the word with the least error possible.

Good luck and have fun !
